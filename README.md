# AI-Community
Building a conversation based around two Generative AI Agents using Cohere's API. WIP


# v0.1
Created a system to allow generative AI, called a "Bot", to be given "Persona's". This allows you to give each bot their own likes and dislikes, enabling them to have dynamic moods based on activities they perform + their likes and dislikes.

Also added simple graphics, as seen in the example below:


## Test Example

In this test, we have given Bot1 the following:

**Likes:** Outdoors

**Dislikes:** Waking up

**Activities Done:** "Just woke up"

From these activities, we get a mood (generated by Cohere's Command Model) of **"Tired"** for Bot1. 

Then, we simulate a conversation between Bot2 and Bot1, where Bot2 asks Bot1 *"How was your day?"*. To which Bot1 responds as follows:

*"I'm so tired. I just woke up and I already feel like I need to go back to bed. I didn't get a wink of sleep all night."*

So far, this indicates a success in what was expected. Bot1 gave a pretty believable answer as if they were actually tired. Additionally, it only talked about the activities it had done, which is also a good sign.

Here's an example of what it looks like graphically (pretty simple graphics for now)

# Next Steps
Continuing forward, I'd like to add the following:

- Multi-way conversation (a.k.a Bot1 can ask questions back to Bot2, or Bot2 can add comments to Bot1's answer)
- Adding the ability for a Bot to perform a random activity and add it to their **"Activities Done"** list. This can lead to longer and more complex dialogue between two Bots. Currently, the activities done list is hard-coded for the sake of testing.
- Graphics could use an update if I ever get the time to flesh it out
